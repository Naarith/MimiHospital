# MimiHospital

A Database Project for our Database Fundamental Class. It is a mock representation of the workings of a Hospital.

## Description

This repository contains SQL files that builds a database with tables that reflect information on what a real hospital would have in their own database. `queries.sql` and `views.sql` contain queries to obtain desired information we would like to obtain. The remaining three files are used to build and populate a sample database. Each SQL file is commented throughout so that you are able to understand the functionality of each statement that would be executed.
